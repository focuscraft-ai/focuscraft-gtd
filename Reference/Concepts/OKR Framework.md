# OKR Framework (Objectives and Key Results)

Framework for setting and tracking goals using Objectives and Key Results methodology.

## What Are OKRs?

**OKR** = Objective + Key Results

- **Objective**: The qualitative goal - what you want to achieve
- **Key Results**: The quantitative metrics - how you'll measure success

## Structure

### Good Objective
- Inspirational and motivational
- Qualitative (describes desired outcome)
- Time-bound (usually quarterly)
- Ambitious but achievable

**Example**: "Launch a best-in-class mobile experience for our customers"

### Good Key Results
- Measurable with specific metrics
- 3-5 per objective (not more)
- Challenging but realistic
- Have clear success criteria

**Example Key Results**:
1. Ship mobile app to app stores with 4.5+ star rating
2. Achieve 10,000 downloads in first month
3. 70% of active users engage weekly

## OKR Levels

### Company OKRs
Set by leadership, typically 3-5 objectives per quarter
- Strategic direction
- Major initiatives
- Company-wide impact

### Department OKRs
Set by department heads, align with company OKRs
- Team-specific goals
- Support company objectives
- Realistic given resources

### Individual OKRs
Set by individuals with manager, align with department OKRs
- Personal contribution
- Growth goals
- Career development

## Scoring OKRs

**Scoring scale**: 0.0 to 1.0

- **0.0 - 0.3**: We missed significantly
- **0.4 - 0.6**: We made progress
- **0.7 - 1.0**: We achieved or exceeded

**Target**: Aim for 0.7 average
- If consistently 1.0, goals aren't ambitious enough
- If consistently < 0.4, goals are unrealistic

## OKR Cadence

### Quarterly Cycle
- **Week 1**: Review previous quarter, set new OKRs
- **Week 6**: Mid-quarter check-in and adjustments
- **Week 12**: Final scoring and retrospective

### Monthly Check-ins
- Progress updates
- Blocker identification
- Resource adjustments

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Many OKRs**
- ❌ 10 objectives with 50 key results
- ✅ 3-5 objectives with 3-5 key results each

**Not Measurable**
- ❌ "Improve team productivity"
- ✅ "Increase sprint velocity from 40 to 50 story points"

**Too Easy**
- ❌ OKRs you're 100% confident you'll achieve
- ✅ OKRs with 60-70% confidence level

**Confusing Activities with Outcomes**
- ❌ "Have 10 customer meetings" (activity)
- ✅ "Increase customer satisfaction score from 7.5 to 8.5" (outcome)

## Example OKRs

**Key Results**:

2. Migrate 30% of web users to mobile within 60 days

### Department Level - Engineering
**Objective**: Build scalable infrastructure for 10x growth

**Key Results**:
1. Complete cloud migration for all production services
2. Reduce deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes
3. Achieve 99.9% uptime across all services

### Individual Level - Senior Engineer
**Objective**: Become technical expert in cloud architecture

**Key Results**:

2. Complete AWS Solutions Architect certification
3. Deliver 2 tech talks on cloud patterns to team

## Tips for Writing Good OKRs

1. **Start with "Why"**: Understand the purpose before setting goals
2. **Involve the Team**: Collaborative OKRs have better buy-in
3. **Make Them Visible**: Everyone should see OKRs regularly
4. **Review Regularly**: Monthly check-ins keep everyone aligned
5. **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge achievements, even partial ones
6. **Learn from Misses**: Low scores are learning opportunities
