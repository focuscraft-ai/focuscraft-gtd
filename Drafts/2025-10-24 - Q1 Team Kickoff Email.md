## Draft Email

Subject: Q1 2026 Kickoff - Our Plan and Priorities

Team,

I'm excited to share our Q1 2026 plan with you. Leadership approved our proposal yesterday, and I want to make sure you understand our direction and how you fit in.

**Our Q1 Mission**: Ship the mobile app, complete the cloud migration, and build a stronger team.

**What We're Doing**:

1. **Product Launch** - Mobile app goes live in March
   - Led by Sarah with support from the full product team
   - This is our biggest customer-requested feature
   - Success metric: 10K downloads in first month

2. **Technical Foundation** - Complete cloud migration
   - Led by Alex and John
   - Moving from legacy infrastructure to modern, scalable platform
   - We've extended timeline to Q1 to prioritize quality over speed

3. **Team Growth** - Adding 3 senior engineers
   - Hiring in phases (Jan, Feb, Mar) to onboard effectively
   - Each new hire will have a dedicated mentor
   - We're investing in documentation and onboarding improvements

**What This Means for You**:

- **More Focus Time** - We're implementing monthly technical debt sprints
- **Better Processes** - New code review SLA and rotation system starting Nov 1
- **Growth Opportunities** - New team members mean mentorship and leadership chances
- **Realistic Timelines** - We're done with crunch time; sustainable pace is our priority

**What I Need from You**:

1. **Feedback on priorities** - Do these make sense? What are we missing?
2. **Ideas for improvements** - What would make Q1 successful for you personally?
3. **Candid communication** - Tell me early if something feels off

We'll discuss this in detail at our all-hands meeting on Nov 1. Until then, I'm available for questions, concerns, or just to chat about what excites or worries you about Q1.

Thanks for making Q4 great despite the challenges. Let's make Q1 even better.

[Your name]
