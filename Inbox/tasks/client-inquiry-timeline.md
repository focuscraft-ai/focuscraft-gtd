# Client Timeline Extension Request

**Context**: Received email from ProTech Industries (key client) requesting 2-week timeline extension for Phase 2 deliverables.

**Background**:
- Original Phase 2 deadline: November 15, 2025
- Requested new deadline: November 30, 2025
- Reason: Their infrastructure team delayed server provisioning due to datacenter issues

**Client Impact**:
- No penalty mentioned in contract for their delays
- They're requesting extension as courtesy notification
- Contract allows for "reasonable accommodations" for force majeure

**Our Impact**:
- Team has capacity to accommodate
- Would actually help us reduce timeline pressure on migration
- Could use extra time for additional testing

**Action Needed**:
1. Confirm with Alex Rivera that team can accommodate
2. Check contract terms (talk to legal if needed)
3. Draft response to client accepting extension
4. Update project timeline and communicate to stakeholders
5. Adjust resource allocation if beneficial

**Related**:
- Client: ProTech Industries
- Project: Phase 2 Implementation
- Contract: #2024-PT-002
- Person: [[People/arivera]] (technical lead on this project)

**Urgency**: Should respond by end of day Friday (Oct 25) to maintain good client relationship

**Email Details**:
- From: David Johnson <djohnson@protech.com>
- Received: Oct 24, 2025 at 8:45 AM
- Subject: Phase 2 Timeline Discussion
