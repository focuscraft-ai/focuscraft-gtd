# Meeting: Tech Leads Sync

**Date**: 2025-10-23 15:00-16:00
**Attendees**: Alex Rivera (lead), John Smith, Michael Torres, You

## Agenda
1. Microservices migration status
2. Technical debt prioritization
3. Q1 capacity planning
4. Code review process improvements

## Discussion Notes

### Microservices Migration
- Current progress: 60% complete
- Authentication service migrated successfully
- Payment service in progress (John leading)
- Blockers: Database schema migrations taking longer than expected
- Timeline: Aiming for Dec 15 completion

**Alex's concerns**:
- Quality vs speed tradeoff feels uncomfortable
- Need better testing coverage before production
- Recommends adding 2-week buffer to timeline

**Team consensus**: Better to ship Q1 2026 than rush Dec deployment

### Technical Debt
Michael presented debt analysis:
- 23 high-priority items identified
- Estimate: 6-8 weeks of dedicated work
- Biggest risks:
  - Legacy authentication code
  - Monolithic database structure
  - Missing monitoring/alerting

**Proposal**: Dedicate one sprint per month to debt reduction

### Q1 Capacity Planning
Discussion of new hire integration:
- 3 senior engineers planned for Q1
- Onboarding takes ~6 weeks to full productivity
- Need to account for mentoring time from existing seniors

**John's point**: "We can't just add people and expect linear velocity increase"

Agreed approach:
- Hire in phases (Jan, Feb, Mar)
- Assign mentors upfront
- Create comprehensive onboarding docs

### Code Review Improvements
Current pain points:
- Reviews taking 2-3 days average
- Blocking deployments
- Some PRs too large

**Solutions proposed**:
- Implement PR rotation system
- Size limits (max 400 lines)
- 24-hour review SLA
- Weekly "PR cleanup" time block

## Action Items

- [ ] **Alex**: Update migration timeline with 2-week buffer and share with leadership (Due: Oct 25)
- [ ] **John**: Draft PR rotation schedule and share with team (Due: Oct 27)
- [ ] **Michael**: Create technical debt roadmap for Q1 (Due: Nov 1)
- [ ] **You**: Approve technical debt sprints in Q1 planning (Due: Oct 30)
- [ ] **Alex**: Document onboarding process for new hires (Due: Nov 15)

## Decisions Made

1. ✅ Extend migration timeline to Q1 2026 (consensus)
2. ✅ Implement monthly technical debt sprints (approved)
3. ✅ Phased hiring approach with mentorship assignments (approved)
4. ✅ New code review process and SLA (to be implemented Nov 1)

## Follow-up Meeting

Next tech leads sync: Oct 30 at 3pm

Topics:
- Migration progress check-in
- Onboarding documentation review
- Q1 capacity model validation
