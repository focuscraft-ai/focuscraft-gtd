# Q1 Budget Proposal Ready for Review

**From**: Sarah Chen <sarah.chen@company.com>
**Date**: 2025-10-24 09:15
**To**: you@company.com
**Priority**: High

Hi,

I've finished the Q1 budget proposal incorporating all the feedback from our planning sessions. The proposal is attached and covers:

- Engineering headcount expansion (3 senior engineers)
- Product development budget ($200K for contractors and tools)
- Marketing campaign for product launch ($150K)
- Infrastructure and cloud migration costs ($100K)

**Total Q1 Request**: $1.2M

**Key Highlights**:
- 15% increase over Q4 budget
- Phased hiring approach to manage cash flow
- Conservative revenue projections based on Q4 trends
- Risk mitigation strategies included

**Action Needed**:
Please review by Friday (Oct 25) so we can present to leadership team on Monday. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on:
1. Engineering headcount timeline
2. Marketing budget allocation
3. Infrastructure investment prioritization

Let me know if you want to discuss any sections in detail. I'm available for a quick call this afternoon if helpful.

Best regards,
Sarah
