Document a GTD system improvement for the knowledge base.

**Purpose**: Capture system improvements with consistent format, auto-detect changes, reduce friction.

**Workflow**:

1. **Detect changes** from git (uncommitted or recent commits)
2. **Ask 4 targeted questions** about the improvement
3. **Generate improvement document** with standard structure
4. **Save to** `Reference/Concepts/GTD/Improvements/`
5. **Ask if you want to commit** the changes to git

This command ensures improvements are documented immediately with full context and consistent quality.
