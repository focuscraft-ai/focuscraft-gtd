Execute the "GTD Daily Workflow - Phase 3: Organize & Prioritize" as defined in CLAUDE.md.

Use the **prioritizer** agent to:

1. Get current context:
   - What time is it? (morning/afternoon/evening)
   - What's on the calendar? (try MCP, fall back to Daily file)
   - How much time is available?

2. Read and analyze tasks from Tasks/Next.md:
   - Score by urgency, energy match, duration fit, strategic value
   - Calculate priority score for each task
   - Consider current context (@office/@home)

3. Generate Daily Priority Report with:
   - **Today's Focus**: Top 3-5 tasks with time block suggestions
   - **Quick Wins**: Sub-15min tasks for gaps
   - **Urgent**: Due today or overdue
   - **This Week**: Tasks due in next 7 days
   - **Consider Tomorrow**: High-value tasks that don't fit today

4. Write report to Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md under "## Daily Priority Report"

**Purpose**: Reduce decision fatigue - know exactly what to work on today.

**Best times to run**:
- Morning (8-9am) to plan full day
- After lunch (1-2pm) to plan afternoon
- When priorities shift due to interruptions

**Next step**: Execute your top priorities!
